## Usage
This site aims to function as closely to the original stem player device as possible. All usage instructions unique to the site are listed below.

### Loading local files
If you have local stem files that you would like to load into the stem player, you can do so by clicking on the folder icon in the top left corner of the page and selecting the folder. Folders should contain 4 audio files, ideally named 1-4 with a typical audio format type such as .mp3, .flac, .wav. If files are not named by numbers 1-4, they will still play fine, but their positions on the player may be unpredictable.


### Keyboard shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts have been included to help better the experience of using the stem player on a pc. They simply allow an alternative way of interacting with the stem player other than touching with the mouse.

* `Spacebar` - Toggles playback, pausing and playing the entire track
* `<Arrowkey>` - Each arrow key controls the volume of it's respective slider. Pressing the arrow key will increase the volume and holding control while pressing the arrow key will decrease the volume.
